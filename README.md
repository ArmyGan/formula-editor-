# formula-editor(公式编辑器)
Convert ASCIIMath to MathML and render it into formula with QT.

This project has run successfully in the environment of vs2013+qt5.5.1 on win7.

The editor first converts asciimath to mathml by python, then renders mathml into formla by QWT, so you must install python(python 2.7 is suggested) and QWT. The specific installation flow and environment configuration can be searched in the net.


##This editor has completed the function of converting ASCIIMath to MathML, you can also add other wonderful functions as you want, for exmaple you can implement converting ASCIIMath to TEX, generating formula SVG or image and dragging and dropping it into word or ppt etc.
